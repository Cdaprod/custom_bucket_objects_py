# Custom Bucket Objects

The `custom_bucket_objects` package, developed by David Cannan, is a LangChain-powered tool designed for transforming Python and Markdown files into structured, clean data objects. This package enhances data handling and analysis efficiency, providing robust solutions for various data parsing and analysis needs.

## Features

- **YAML Metadata Parsing**: Interprets YAML strings and converts them into structured metadata.
- **Table Content Parsing**: Analyzes and converts table content into structured `Table` objects.
- **Python Script Analysis**: Extracts and structures components like imports and classes from Python scripts.
- **Markdown Document Parsing**: Processes Markdown documents to extract metadata, tables, and code blocks.
- **Integration with MinIO and Weaviate Clients**: Facilitates extended data handling capabilities.
- **LangChain-Powered**: Leverages the LangChain framework for efficient and scalable data processing.

## Installation

To install the package, ensure you have Python version 3.6 or later. Then, you can install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Cdaprod/custom_bucket_objects.git
```

## Usage

After installation, import the necessary components in your Python script to start utilizing the package's functionalities:

```python
from custom_bucket_objects import [ModuleName]
```

Replace `[ModuleName]` with the specific module you wish to use (e.g., `parse_yaml_metadata`, `parse_table`, etc.).

# Creating a GPT Agent Action for the App

To create a GPT agent action for the `custom_bucket_objects` app, we need to define an OpenAPI specification for the API that the GPT agent will interact with. This API will expose the functionalities of your package as HTTP endpoints that the GPT agent can call.

Here's an example of how you might set up a basic OpenAPI specification for your package:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Custom Bucket Objects API
  version: 0.1.0
  description: API for interacting with the Custom Bucket Objects package
  contact:
    name: David Cannan
    email: Cdaprod@Cdaprod.dev
    url: https://github.com/Cdaprod/custom_bucket_objects
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:8000
    description: Development server
paths:
  /parse-yaml-metadata:
    post:
      operationId: parseYamlMetadata
      summary: Parses YAML metadata from a string
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                yaml_content:
                  type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Parsed metadata
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  metadata:
                    type: object
                    additionalProperties: true
  # Add other paths for each functionality

# Add components and schemas as necessary
```

In this spec, you expose a POST endpoint at `/parse-yaml-metadata` that accepts YAML content and returns the parsed metadata. Similarly, you would add other endpoints for each functionality of your package.

To implement this API, you can use a Python web framework like Flask or FastAPI. The GPT agent would then send requests to these endpoints and receive responses, allowing it to interact with your package's capabilities.

With your OpenAPI specification for the Custom Bucket Objects API now set up, the next steps involve implementing the API, testing it, and possibly creating a user interface or client integration. Here's a structured approach to move forward:

### 1. Implement the API Endpoints
Using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI, implement the API endpoints as defined in your OpenAPI specification. Each endpoint should correspond to a function in your Python code:

- **`/parse-yaml-metadata`**: Connect to a function that parses YAML content.
- **`/parse-table`**: Link to your table parsing logic.
- **`/parse-python-script`**: Implement parsing of Python scripts.
- **`/parse-markdown-content`**: Set up parsing for Markdown files.
- **`/minio-action`** and **`/weaviate-action`**: Implement interactions with MinIO and Weaviate clients.

For example, using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict
from your_package import parse_yaml, parse_table  # Import your actual functions

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/parse-yaml-metadata")
def parse_yaml_endpoint(yaml_content: str):
    return parse_yaml(yaml_content)

# Define other endpoints similarly
```

### 2. Validate Your API with the OpenAPI Specification
Ensure that your implementation aligns with the OpenAPI specification. You can use tools like Swagger UI to interact with your API and check its compliance.

### 3. Write Unit Tests
Create unit tests for each endpoint to ensure they work as expected. Test various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.

### 4. Documentation
Update your `README.md` to include instructions on how to run the API server and examples of how to interact with the API.

### 5. Deploy the API
Consider deploying your API to a server or a cloud provider for wider accessibility. Look into options like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform.

### 6. Create a Client Library or UI
To make it easier for users to interact with your API, consider creating a client library in Python or a simple web-based user interface. This can be particularly useful for non-technical users.

### 7. Integrate with GPT Agent
To create a GPT agent action, you'll need to connect the capabilities of your API with a GPT-powered agent. This could involve:

- Sending requests to your API endpoints from within a GPT-3 interaction script.
- Using the responses from your API as part of the GPT-3 dialogue or processing.

For example:

```python
import openai
import requests

def gpt_agent_action(user_input):
    # Example: User input triggers parsing of YAML
    response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/parse-yaml-metadata", json={"yaml_content": user_input})
    parsed_data = response.json()

    # Further processing with GPT-3
    gpt_response = openai.Completion.create(prompt=f"Process this data: {parsed_data}", ...)
    return gpt_response
```

### 8. Continuous Improvement
Regularly update and improve the API based on user feedback and new requirements.

By following these steps, you'll be able to fully implement, test, and deploy your Custom Bucket Objects API, making it accessible for use in various applications, including integration with GPT agents.
