# TODO: 

Certainly! To create an effective `main-main.py` script that integrates `main.py`, `weaviate-main.py`, and `minio-main.py`, it is important to ensure that each module is designed for compatibility and proper data flow between them. Let's go through each module and make necessary updates for seamless integration:

1. **Updates to `main.py`**:
   - Ensure that each function in `main.py` (like `parse_markdown_content`, `parse_python_script`, etc.) is designed to take in data in a generic format that can be received from MinIO.
   - Functions should return data in a format that is ingestible by Weaviate.

2. **Updates to `minio-main.py`**:
   - Modify `process_bucket_data` in `minio-main.py` to return data instead of printing or processing it within the function. This data will be used by the parsing functions in `main.py`.
   - Ensure the connection details and bucket names are configurable or passed as parameters.

3. **Updates to `weaviate-main.py`**:
   - Adjust `ingest_data` to handle data processed by `main.py`.
   - The schema definition in `define_schema` should match the structure of the processed data.

4. **Creating `main-main.py`**:
   ```python
   from minio_main import connect_to_minio, process_bucket_data
   from weaviate_main import connect_to_weaviate, define_schema, ingest_data
   from main import parse_markdown_content

   def main():
       # Connect to MinIO
       minio_client = connect_to_minio()
       bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"

       # Retrieve data from MinIO
       minio_data = process_bucket_data(minio_client, bucket_name)

       # Process data using main.py
       processed_data = [parse_markdown_content(data) for data in minio_data]

       # Connect to Weaviate and define schema
       weaviate_client = connect_to_weaviate()
       define_schema(weaviate_client)

       # Ingest data into Weaviate
       for data in processed_data:
           ingest_data(weaviate_client, data)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

In `main-main.py`:
- Retrieve data from MinIO.
- Process the data using functions from `main.py`.
- Ingest the processed data into Weaviate.
- Ensure that error handling and logging are implemented for robustness.

By making these updates and ensuring that each component of your system is compatible with the others, you can create a cohesive workflow that leverages the strengths of each module.

## Deciding on How to Handling Data

To handle data effectively in the `main-main.py` script, integrating `main.py`, `weaviate-main.py`, and `minio-main.py`, we need a strategy that goes beyond simply printing the output. Here are some effective ways to manage the data flow:

1. **Data Collection and Aggregation**:
   - In `minio-main.py`, modify `process_bucket_data` to collect and return data from MinIO instead of printing it. This data should be in a format compatible with the processing functions in `main.py`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def process_bucket_data(client, bucket_name):
         data_collection = []
         objects = client.list_objects(bucket_name)
         for obj in objects:
             data = client.get_object(bucket_name, obj.object_name).read()
             data_collection.append(data.decode('utf-8'))
         return data_collection
     ```

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Use functions from `main.py` to process the collected data. This processing should transform the data into a structure that can be ingested into Weaviate.
   - Example:
     ```python
     processed_data = [parse_markdown_content(data) for data in minio_data]
     ```

3. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Modify `ingest_data` in `weaviate-main.py` to handle a list of processed data items and ingest them into Weaviate.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def ingest_data(client, processed_data_list):
         for data_item in processed_data_list:
             client.data_object.create(
                 data_item.dict(), 
                 class_name="YourClassName"
             )
     ```

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Instead of printing, implement logging to track the flow and status of data processing. This can be crucial for debugging and monitoring the systemâ€™s performance.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import logging
     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

     # Use logging instead of print statements
     logging.info("Data processed successfully")
     ```

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling to manage exceptions or failures during data collection, processing, and ingestion.
   - Example:
     ```python
     try:
         processed_data = [parse_markdown_content(data) for data in minio_data]
     except Exception as e:
         logging.error(f"Error in processing data: {e}")
     ```

6. **Integration in main-main.py**:
   - Ensure that the workflow in `main-main.py` utilizes these updated functions and handles data according to the above strategies.

This approach will make your data workflow more robust and scalable. It allows for better control, monitoring, and debugging capabilities, which are essential for maintaining and improving data processing pipelines.
